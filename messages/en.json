Since then, web development has become my true passion, and I enjoy doing it to this day. Today, I work in a small team of 4 people, and together we complete freelance projects. I specialize in frontend development, creating modern and user-friendly interfaces. Each new project is an opportunity for me to create something unique and useful. By working on various tasks, I apply advanced technologies and best practices to create high-quality and efficient web applications. My passion for web development drives me to make the internet better and more accessible for everyone."
